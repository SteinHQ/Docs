Stein Expedite helps you

- display data from Google Sheets on your website, using handlebars-like `{{ }}` syntax
- directly link a form to a Google Sheet.

All straight through the simple, beloved HTML.

Expedite is a part of the Stein suite, and is thus powered by the Stein API. To utilize Expedite, though, you don't need to learn the details of the core API.

First, [create an API for your sheet](create-api.md) via the interface. It's nothing technical, and wouldn't take you more than a couple of minutes.

Read on to learn how to install Expedite on your site.
