Start by creating an API.

## Prepare your sheet
Populate the first row of your sheet with the columns names. Think of these as the field names of your sheet-powered database. There are no restrictions on what you can name them.

The following rows should contain the corresponding data.

## Copy your sheet's URL
Find your spreadsheet's URL in your browser's address bar.

```text
Example sheet URL:

```

## Create an API
After you sign up, you'll be prompted for your sheet's URL. This sheet will be used for creating your first API. Paste the URL to get started with Stein.

You can later create more APIs from your dashboard.
