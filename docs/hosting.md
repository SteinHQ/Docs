Stein is open-source, and can be accessed via the managed service or be self-hosted.

## Managed Service

The **most efficient and easy way** to deploy a production-ready instance of Stein is via the [official fully-managed service](https://steinhq.com). A couple of clicks will get you a fast and reliable API. Not only will it save you _hours of maintenance per month_, but youâ€™ll be _supporting open source software_ and _getting great service_!

To get started, sign up at the [Stein website](https://steinhq.com).

## Self-hosted

Stein is fully open source. You may customise it to your needs, determine your functionality, and host it yourself.

The option for self hosting is currently under active development, and will be available soon! As a beta tester, you'll be the first to try it.
